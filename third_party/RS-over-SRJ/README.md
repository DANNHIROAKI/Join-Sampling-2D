# KDTree-4D

A static 4D KD-tree baseline for **exact** uniform random sampling over 2D rectangle intersection joins.

This directory contains a KDS-style baseline (range counting + range sampling) and a lightweight KD-tree implementation that supports orthogonal range **COUNT** and range **SEARCH** in configurable dimensionality. The join predicate is 2D rectangle strict intersection, expressed as a 4D orthogonal range query via the standard embedding.

## Problem

Given two relations of axis-aligned rectangles in 2D:

- $R = \{r_0,\dots,r_{n-1}\}$
- $S = \{s_0,\dots,s_{m-1}\}$

the intersection join result set is:

$J = \{(r, s)\mid r\in R,\ s\in S,\ r \cap s \neq \emptyset\}$.

The sampler returns $t$ pairs from $J$ **with replacement**.  
Each returned pair is an **independent uniform** sample from $J$.

---

## Rectangle semantics

### Half-open rectangles

Each rectangle is half-open on every axis:

$[lo, hi)$.

The input must satisfy, for each rectangle $b$ and each axis $d\in\{0,1\}$:

$b.lo[d] < b.hi[d]$.

All rectangle coordinates are finite IEEE-754 floating-point values (no NaN).

### Strict overlap (touching is not an intersection)

Rectangles that only touch at edges or corners are **not** considered intersecting.

For rectangles $a$ and $b$ in 2D, $a \cap b \neq \emptyset$ iff for each axis $d\in\{0,1\}$:

$a.lo[d] < b.hi[d]\ \land\ b.lo[d] < a.hi[d]$.

---

## Algorithm

For each rectangle $r\in R$, define:

$w(r) = |\{ s \in S \mid r \cap s \neq \emptyset \}|$,

and:

$W = \sum_{r\in R} w(r) = |J|$.

The sampler is:

1. Build a static KD-tree over embedded points of $S$ (Section “4D embedding”).
2. For every $r\in R$, compute $w(r)$ by exact range counting on the KD-tree.
3. Build a Walker alias table over $R$ with weights $\{w(r)\}$.
4. Repeat $t$ times:
   - sample $r$ from $R$ with probability $w(r)/W$
   - sample $s$ uniformly from $\{s\in S \mid r\cap s\neq\emptyset\}$ using KD-tree range sampling
   - output $(r,s)$

### Uniformity proof

For any $(r,s)\in J$:

$P[(r,s)] = P[r]\cdot P[s\mid r] = \frac{w(r)}{W}\cdot \frac{1}{w(r)} = \frac{1}{|J|}$.

Independence follows from sampling with replacement using a random number generator stream.

## 4D embedding

Each 2D rectangle $s$ is embedded as a 4D point:

$p(s) = (s.lo.x,\ s.lo.y,\ s.hi.x,\ s.hi.y)\in\mathbb{R}^4$.

For a fixed query rectangle $r$, strict overlap constraints:

- $s.lo.x < r.hi.x$
- $s.lo.y < r.hi.y$
- $s.hi.x > r.lo.x$
- $s.hi.y > r.lo.y$

form a 4D orthogonal range query over points $p(s)$, with:

- upper bounds on $(s.lo.x, s.lo.y)$
- lower bounds on $(s.hi.x, s.hi.y)$

---

## Closed-range conversion via `std::nextafter`

`utils/kdtree.hpp` uses **closed** ranges:

$qlo[d] \le x[d] \le qhi[d]$.

Strict inequalities are converted to closed bounds using `std::nextafter` on floating-point values:

- $x < a \iff x \le \mathrm{nextDown}(a)$
- $x > a \iff x \ge \mathrm{nextUp}(a)$

For rectangle $r$, the embedded 4D query bounds are:

- $qlo = (-\infty,\ -\infty,\ \mathrm{nextUp}(r.lo.x),\ \mathrm{nextUp}(r.lo.y))$
- $qhi = (\mathrm{nextDown}(r.hi.x),\ \mathrm{nextDown}(r.hi.y),\ +\infty,\ +\infty)$

`nextUp/nextDown` are identity on $\pm\infty$.

---

## KD-tree range counting and uniform range sampling

### KD-tree representation

`utils/kdtree.hpp` implements a static KD-tree with:

- a single point array `points_`
- each subtree mapped to a contiguous interval `[l, r)` inside `points_`
- per-node bounding boxes `(lo, hi)` computed bottom-up by merging children
- closed range semantics: $qlo \le x \le qhi$

Each KD-tree node stores:

- `l, r, mid`: subtree interval and median index
- `left, right`: child node indices
- `axis`: split axis
- `lo, hi`: bounding box of the subtree (inclusive)

### Exact range counting

`Count(qlo, qhi)` returns the exact number of embedded points in the closed range.

A subtree is pruned when its bounding box is disjoint from the query.  
A subtree contributes its full size when its bounding box is contained in the query.

Worst-case time is $O(|S|)$.

### Range decomposition for uniform sampling

`Search(qlo, qhi, out)` returns a decomposition of the query result set into items:

- **subtree items** (`fully_contained=true`): a fully contained subtree block
- **point items** (`fully_contained=false`): the median point stored at a node that lies in range

This decomposition is a partition of the result set with no duplication.

Uniform sampling from the query result is implemented by:

1. assign an integer weight to each item:
   - subtree item: `weight = subtree_size`
   - point item: `weight = 1`
2. sample one item index via an alias table using these weights
3. if a subtree item is chosen, sample a uniform offset inside the subtree interval `[l, r)` and return that point
4. if a point item is chosen, return the node’s median point

Because each result point belongs to exactly one item, and each item is selected proportionally to its size contribution, the sampled point is uniform over the query result set.

## Baseline class and API

The join sampler is implemented in `isrjs_kds/isrjs_kds.hpp`:

` sjs::baselines::rs_over_srj::RSOverSRJKDTreeSamplingBaseline<2, sjs::Scalar> `

Properties:

- input dimension: `Dim == 2` (compile-time enforced)
- embedding dimension: `D = 2 * Dim = 4`
- `Build(ds, cfg)`: builds a KD-tree over embedded rectangles in `ds.S`
- `Count(cfg, rng, out)`: computes exact $|J|$ by summing $w(r)$ over `ds.R`
- `Sample(cfg, rng, out)`: produces `t = cfg.run.t` samples with replacement
- `Name()`: `"kd_tree_sampling"`
- `Enumerate(...)`: deterministic plane-sweep enumeration on axis 0 (verification / enumerator API)

Hard limits:

- `|S| < 2^32` (KD-tree indices and payloads are `uint32_t`)
- `t < 2^32` (sample count is stored as `uint32_t` inside `Sample()`)
- `|J| < 2^64` (otherwise `Count()` reports overflow)

Precondition:

- $|J| \ge 1$.

## Build and run: sanity-check demo

`isrjs_kds/main.cpp` is a minimal demo guarded by `RS_OVER_SRJ_DEMO_MAIN`.

This codebase is designed to be compiled inside the Join-Sampling-2D source tree. The directory layout assumed by the command below is:

- Join-Sampling-2D repository root: `./`
- this directory: `./third_party/KDTree-4D/`

Build and run:

~~~bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -DRS_OVER_SRJ_DEMO_MAIN \
  -I. -Ithird_party/KDTree-4D \
  third_party/KDTree-4D/isrjs_kds/main.cpp \
  -o kdtree4d_demo

./kdtree4d_demo
~~~

The executable constructs a small in-memory rectangle dataset, prints the exact join size, then prints `t = 10` sampled pairs as `(r_id, s_id)`.
